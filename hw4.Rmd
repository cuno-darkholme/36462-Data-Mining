**Question 4:**
Load the COMPAS data.

(a) Using the training data, create a plot of priors against age. Use shape or color to indicate whether the arrestee was a recidivist. Hint: Because many arrestees have the same combination of age and priors, you may want to use the jitter function to add a small amount of noise to the plot, so that diï¬€erent people will show up as distinct points. (See the examples at the end of help(jitter).) 

```{r}
line <- scan("a.txt")
training <- data.frame()
testing <- data.frame()
for (i in 1:nrow(rawdata)){
  if (i %in% line){
    training <- rbind(training, rawdata[i,])
  } else {
    testing <- rbind(testing, rawdata[i,])
  }
}
```

```{r}
plot(training$priors_count, training$age)
```
